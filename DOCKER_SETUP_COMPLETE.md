- ✅ PWA support with proper service worker handling
- ✅ Gzip compression for better performance
- ✅ Static asset caching
- ✅ API proxy configuration
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ SPA routing support

### 3. **.dockerignore** - Optimized build context
- Excludes unnecessary files (node_modules, logs, etc.)
- Reduces build context size for faster builds

### 4. **docker-compose.yml** - Production deployment
- Production service with Nginx
- Development service with hot reload
- Optional nginx-proxy for load balancing
- Health checks and restart policies

### 5. **docker-compose.dev.yml** - Development environment
- Development-focused configuration
- Volume mounting for hot reload
- Optimized for local development

### 6. **DOCKER.md** - Comprehensive documentation
- Quick start guide
- Available commands
- Troubleshooting tips
- Security considerations
- Monitoring and scaling

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Build and run production image
docker-compose up ccbc-pwa

# Or build manually
docker build -t ccbc-pwa:latest --target production .
docker run -p 8080:80 ccbc-pwa:latest
```

### Development Environment
```bash
# Run development server with hot reload
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Or use profiles
docker-compose --profile dev up ccbc-pwa-dev
```

## ✅ Tested and Working

### Build Process
